Austin Has a ‘Certified Racist’ Comedian With LA Transplant Tony Hinchcliffe

When Joe Rogan made a much-publicized move to Austin during the pandemic, he brought along his friend and colleague Tony Hinchcliffe. Apparently they didn't get the memo that Austin wants to stay ""weird,"" not racist. 

Hinchcliffe is a successful comedian who's been a staff writer for Comedy Central and currently hosts the podcast Kill Tony. For the last few months, he's been a staple in the Austin comedy scene and earned fame this week in particular when a video of his set at Vulcan Gas Co. went viral for its rampant racism. 

Comedian Peng Dang posted the video of Hinchcliffe's set to his Twitter account. He wrote: “Last week in Austin, I got to bring up Tony Hinchcliffe. This is what he said. Happy Asian (AAPI) Heritage Month!”

The video shows Dang introducing Hinchcliffe, who immediately calls Dang a “filthy little fucking chink"" and begins mocking Dang's set with a fake Asian accent.
