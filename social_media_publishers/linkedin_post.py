Even though the anti-Asian hate is not under the spotlight in todayâ€™s news, 
the issue still exists. The AAPI community and our allies could sit still 
doing nothing today, waiting until another horrible incident will inevitably 
happen again. Or we could continue the momentum that we all built together 
in the past few months. We shall continue contributing to the cause, one 
small thing at a time. Together, we can eventually gain the racial equality we deserve.
